I am from Huruma's orphanage which help children with needs and also those who are orphans.this orpanage is located in Eldoret.<br><br>
This orphanage helps to overcome problems such as early school dropout,early pregnancies and early marriages.It also helps  children to coop up with health problems<br><br>
This orphanage also helps children who are needy t0 aquire education which prevents them from being involved in some social crimes like stealing and others. I also helps  this children not to involving in the use of alcohol and other drugs.it also provide them with guiding and councelling and motivating them not to give up.<br><br>
there are many children whom when their parents dies, they are taken by relative and thus they are forced to labour without rest and so this Huruma orphanage helps to keep them safe and free from child labour which can make them healthy and comfortable and feel at home<br><br>
